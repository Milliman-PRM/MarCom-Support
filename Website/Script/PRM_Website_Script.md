####Our Solution – Frequently Asked Questions – *LINK*
* Who are the intended users for PRM Analytics?
 * PRM Analytics (PRM) is intended for use by care coordinators, managers of care coordinators, medical directors, physicians, and others who are responsible for population health management. PRM has utility to health insurance payers, healthcare providers, and employers.
* How does the PRM algorithm work?
  * The PRM algorithm is an innovative predictive model that provides critical information about each attributed patient. It connects the clinical characteristics of the patient with the estimated financial value that may be derived from the management of that patient. Providing the necessary business and clinical intelligence needed to generate insights and drive better decisions. Each patient population analyzed using PRM will have unique results. The PRM algorithm is an innovative predicative analytic that provides critical information about each attributed patient. It connects the clinical characteristics of the patient withe the the estimated financial value that may be derived from the management of that patient, allowing an entity to strategically select and manage patients for the best return on investment. Each patient population analyzed using PRM will have unique results. The premise for ranking is that patients, whose healthcare expense volatility a potential for avoidable costs are the highest, should be ranked as a priority for additional care management as opposed to simply the highest cost patients or the highest risk patients.
* What does potentially avoidable costs mean?
  * The term 'potentially avoidable' costs refers to the acute services related to chronic conditions that have the potential to be avoided via enhanced ambulatory care management.
* How does PRM protect consumer privacy?
  * PRM operates under HIPPA, which establishes the requirements for the disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI). The strict and comprehensive requirements are part of the legislation and are universally recognized throughout the insurance and healthcare industries. PRM prides itself on our secure systems and state of the art infrastructure that keeps consumer data confidential.
* How are the reports delivered? 
  * PRM is delivered as a web-based application, thatapplication, which is accessed by clients through a secure sign-on process. Access to the tool is not available without a license agreement. PRM, at the user level, does not provide user controlled predictive analytics. Users haveare limited to view and filter capabilitiesy through the PRM interface.
* How does PRM support providers participating in APMs, MIPs, or those that have yet to decide which MACRA track to take?
  * Help organizations meet their cost benchmarks by identifying patient populations or conditions contributing the most avoidable costs to the system
  * Identify patient populations that have not yet received services related to quality metrics, which allows physicians to prioritize them to ensure the quality metric is met
  * Integrate clinical, claims, and enrollment data from across the system to facilitate care coordination across the entire care team and contribute to clinical practice improvement
* Why should I invest in this product?
  * Current use of this tool in customer settings has resulted in a consistently high level of user satisfaction and increased management efficiency. Specific comments indicative of satisfaction are:
   * “It takes me 2 minutes to figure out what to do for a patient when I land on the Conditions and Risk Factors page”.
   * “I was able to answer a question in 90 seconds when it used to take an analyst 2 weeks to provide me with the data”.
   * “I don’t need to look at the EMR anymore. This has everything I need”.
   * “This is amazing, the best I have ever seen”.
* How is PRM different from the other population health management solutions in the market?
  * PRM is not a factor-driven model. This is an important distinction for PRM as compared to metrics/factors developed from large databases. The former will assign the same metrics/factors to each patient with the same morbidity and demographic composition. However, not all provider institutions and payors have the same level of population management skills or outcomes. PRM can recognize and accommodate these differences, thus providing important insight into efficient healthcare management.
* How does PRM protect consumer privacy?
  * PRM operates under HIPPA, which establishes the requirements for the disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI). The strict and comprehensive requirements are part of the legislation and are universally recognized throughout the insurance and healthcare industries. PRM prides itself on our secure systems and state of the art infrastructure that keeps consumer data confidential.
* What does potentially avoidable costs mean?
  * The term 'potentially avoidable' costs refers to the acute services related to chronic conditions that have the potential to be avoided via enhanced ambulatory care management.
