####Kelsie thoughts

PRM Analytics is a product that uses predictive analytics to find potentially avoidable costs at the patient level.

This is both helpful for the care coordinators for lowering hospital costs, and for the patient in receiving the best quality of care.

By using our product, you can find trends that are occurring in your data and from there drill deeper. 

Our CCR allows you to drill down into the patient level to see what is driving costs.

After finding the issues at the patient level, you can then act on those patients to intervene with those potentially avoidable costs in the future. 

We strive to help better the patient care and save you money.
