####Outline:

* Introduction
 * What is PRM Analytics
     * Milliman PRM Analytics® connects the clinical characteristics of the patient with the estimated actuarial value that may be derived from the management of that patient.  This allows the user to strategically select and manage patients for the best clinical opportunity to reduce actuarial risk.
      * PRM Analytics is a product team focused on helping their clients make the most of the risk they have assumed.  Our flagship offerings help identify managed patients who are ripe for intervention via care coordination.  We help target efforts at the patients we think are most at risk of large, potentially avoidable healthcare expenditures.  Instead of just a list of patient names, we provide online reports that let users drill into the risk factors of each patient and see why we identified each one as an opportunity.
  * Why was PRM Analytics developed
     * Milliman PRM Analytics® was inspired by the customer relationship management concept and its goal is to assemble the components necessary to impact patient decision making in a positive way.
  * What makes us unique
     * Our clients choose us because we are focused on relentless, continual improvement.  We listen to our clients' needs and feedback and iteratively adjust our solutions to help them better.  Our team is highly comfortable with all types of healthcare data and experts in predictive and inferential modelling.
* Potentially Avoidable Costs
  * What does potentially avoidable mean?
     * The phrase ‘potentially avoidable healthcare expenses’ refers to the medically necessary acute services that may occur due to poorly managed chronic conditions.  
  * How we predict these potentially avoidable costs
  * How this makes us different from competitors
     * It is one of the first predictive tools to connect the clinical characteristics of the patient with the estimated financial impact that may be derived from the management of that patient, providing critical business information required for care management decision making.
* Who uses our tool
 * Care coordinators, Medical directors, Physicians, Other professionals responsible for pop health management
     * We help medical directors with population health analytics.  We help care coordinator directors plan intervention initiatives.  We help care coordinators quickly understand a patient's pertinent history and individualized risk factors.  We're willing to help medical directors have healthy conversations with their providers about cost and quality metric performance.
* How the tool is used (incorporating the predictive analytics)
 * The tool provides information at the population level and facilitates drill-down to the individual patient level, giving care managers the ability to understand the clinical and nonclinical drivers of potentially avoidable healthcare expenditures for each patient.
 * We have recently added patient level insights into why each patient did or did not pass each measure.  These insights can be leveraged during any interaction with the patient to facilitate improved results.
