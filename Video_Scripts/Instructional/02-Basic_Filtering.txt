PRM Analytics Tools make exploring and filtering your data easy.
Starting on the filter tab, you will find a series of list boxes that allow you to make selections which filter the data.
To make a selection, simply click on the desired value from the list box.
In addition to selecting a single value, you can also click and drag to select multiple adjoining values, or hold Control and make multiple selections from anywhere in the list.
Once you have made your selections, they will turn green, indicating that those values are now selected, and they will appear in the current selections bar above.
As you make selections, objects on the page will automatically update based on the values that you have chosen.
It's important to note that making selections will cause some values to grey out, indicating that those values are no longer available given your current selections.
Additionally, certain list boxes allow you to search using a word or phrase.
