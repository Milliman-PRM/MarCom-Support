All PRM Analytics Tools have the same basic navigational structure.
At the top of the page you will find a row of tabs that will take you to each of the major functional areas of the report.
These tabs are visible from anywhere in the report, making it easy to navigate between each section.
In some instances you will find an additional row of tabs that allow you to explore the data in that section of the report.
Clicking on a tab will cause it to change color, allowing you to easily identify where you are in the report.
In some instances one or more of the tabs may be greyed out, indicating that the section is not currently available.
When this happens, hovering your mouse over the tab will provide a brief message indicating the reason that the section is currently unavailable.
